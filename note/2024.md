<h1>Happy New Year</h1>

For anyone stumbling here, happy 2024. Its a bit late, i know, but I have been a bit into my work and didn't get time to update anything here........(actually, that might be an excuse, but meh...)

I have never been a resolution guy as things happen and you won't always be able to keep your promises, even the once - ESPECIALLY THE ONCE - you keep to yourself.
Still this year, there are several things, that I would like to........accomplish.........

 1. New job (wishful thinking ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤ž)
 2. Learning to use a game engine and its language/coding part.
 3. Maintaining this site and adding new articles (I have a couple in the oven. One about power-bi, I am kinda super stocked to document!!)
 4. Updating this site - visually (To dip my toes into [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) if possible)
 5. Contributions to open-source projects. (yeah........)

There are stuff on 'personal' side that I would like to do, but I am not listing them here......If I achieve them, I would try to add/upload them here.

Well then, i'll see you in the next article - hopefully not long......
