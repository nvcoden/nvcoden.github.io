<h1>Happy New Year</h1>

2024 has been nothing but eventful.\
Lots of things happened to me all round. Emotionally, physically, mentally, psychologically......and all the -llys.....  

Lets review all the "resolutions" from 2024, that I wrote down

1. New job (wishful thinking 🤣🤞)

        Not exactly a new Job, but it is kind of a new job. I can say i am employed by the same employer, but the work i do is different now.

2. Learning a game engine and its language/coding part.
		
        Nope.....nothing happened in this regard. Forwarding this to 2025 😶‍🌫️🫣
3. Maintaining this site and adding new articles (I have a couple in the oven. One about power-bi, I am kinda super stocked to document!!)
		
            .........yeah.....about that......😬. I have put some up, and i love i got to dive into them. I have some that I cannot publish, and one I would have liked to, but I don't have the resources to create the article/documentation on. (It was about a technology I was using at my previous job position)
		    
            As for the site, I have visions in mind, but no plans currently.


4. Updating this site visually (To dip my toes into htmx if possible)
		    
            Welp, life happens

5. Contributions to opensource projects. (yeah........)
		    
            yeah...........no....👀

- Well , looking though my retrospective, there were other things that came to my life unexpectedly. Almost all of them are personal, so not gonna discuss here.

- Come 2025, I am thinking of having another set of resolutions and see where it goes. And for now, those would be -


	1. Make a game. 
	
		Any game, possibly/probably Android 🎮
	
	2. Hand in hand with that, document stuff that I learn along - (possible devlogs? 😶‍🌫️)
	
	3. Update this site. (Yes, shamelessly carry forwarding from last year 😂)
	4. Read more books. 
		
		I do love to read, but compared to 10 books in 2023, I could only finish 1 book in 2024 ☠️🤦. Need to change that. I track it as I have a profile in GoodReads. So this includes, only standard books and Comics, nothing else)
	5. Learn a language.

	 	My current job position doesn't involve programming for majority of the part. Just some python stuff here and there. But despite that, I want to learn something on my own.  
	  This might be taken over the goal # 1, but lets see.  

I guess, thats all for now............\
2024 surprised me in a lot of ways. I learned a lot of things I didn't know about myself, and confirmed many things I thought about me. I am looking forward to what 2025 has in store for me.

Happy (belated) New Year
